# sourcecheck_api
Official Repo for the SourceCheck™ API.

This is the repository for our server code.

Currently we have a Source and and Organization object.

Accountability is about transparency. Thats why the SourceCheck™ api will always be opensource.

We have a basic crud api working.

## ToDo:

Expand on ownership association chains.
Create data import and feedback api.
Prepair for front end plugin.

To speed development we have chosen to use the sails.js node framework for our backend.
