Official Repo for the Sourcecheck API.

This is the repository for our server code.

Currently we have a Source and and Organization object.

We have a basic crud api working.

## ToDo:

Expand on ownership association chains.
Create data import and feedback api.
Prepair for front end plugin.

To speed development we have chosen to use the sails.js node framework for our backend.
Sails a robust MVC model and organization. It's documentation is awesome: http://sailsjs.org
